The dataset folder is used for training the Yolo11 model (YoloFineTuning/yolo_fine_tuning.py)
The split_data is created from YoloFineTuning/data_split.py, and manually moved to this folder

The reason its placed in the root directory and not inside of YoloFineTuning is because this is the default location for UltraLytics
(Package that contains YOLO11), so instead of having everyone change their default path, it's easier to just place it here
